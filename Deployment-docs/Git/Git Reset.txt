Be careful that this will create an "alternate reality" for people who have already fetch/pulled/cloned from the remote repository. 
But in fact, it's quite simple:

    git reset HEAD^ # remove commit locally
    git push origin +HEAD # force-push the new HEAD commit
If you want to still have it in your local repository and only remove it from the remote, then you can use:

    git push origin +HEAD^:<name of your branch, most likely 'master'>
