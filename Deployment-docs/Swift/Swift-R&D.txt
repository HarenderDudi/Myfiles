part-power:
	If you've got way more than 100 partitions per disk, your replication passes take longer. Each partition gets its own directory, and they all have to be scanned.

	If you've got way fewer than 100 partitions per disk, your data distribution will be more uneven than you want. You'll have to keep more free space on your disks in order to avoid their getting full.

	Also, please note that a Swift partition has absolutely nothing to do with a disk partition. A Swift partition is a subset of the range of MD5; a disk partition is a subset of the addressable sectors on that disk.
	
	
	
	The number of partitions in a ring affects performance, and it needs to be chosen carefully because it cannot be changed easily. Swift documentation recommends a minimum of 100 partitions per drive to ensure even distribution across servers.

	Taking the maximum anticipated number of drives multiplied by 100 and then rounded off to the nearest power of 2 provides the minimum number of total partitions. Using a number higher than needed will mean extremely uniform distribution, but at the cost of performance, since more partitions put a higher burden on replicators and other post-processing jobs. Therefore, users should not overestimate the ultimate size of the cluster.

	For example, let's assume that we expect our cluster to have a maximum of 1,000 nodes, each with 60 disks. This gives us 60 x 1,000 x 100 = 6,000,000 partitions. Rounded off to the nearest power of two, we get 2^23 = 8,388,608. The value that will be used to create the ring will therefore be 23. We did not discuss disk size in this computation, but note that a cluster with smaller/faster disks (for example, a 2 TB SAS drive) will perform better than a cluster with larger/slower disks (for example, a 6 TB SATA drive) with the same number of partitions.
