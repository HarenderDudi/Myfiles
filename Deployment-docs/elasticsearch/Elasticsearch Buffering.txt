Refresh vs Flush
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19963406/refresh-vs-flush


Note : flush : every 30min or when translog becomes too big.
       refresh : every 1sec.
       translog backup: 5sec.
              
>> translog setting : index.translog.flush_threshold_size: Once the translog hits this size, a flush will happen. Defaults to 512mb.
                      index.translog.flush_threshold_ops: After how many operations to flush. Defaults to unlimited.
                      index.translog.flush_threshold_period: How long to wait before triggering a flush regardless of translog size. Defaults to 30m.
                      index.translog.interval: How often to check if a flush is needed, randomized between the interval value and 2x the interval value. Defaults to 5s
                      
>> The 30% indexing buffer has nothing to do with refreshes, but with flushes. An automatic flush is triggered when the index buffer gets full or when one of the transaction log 
    thresholds is passed:
    http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-modules-translog.html
    Increasing the buffer and translog sizes will make ES flush less often and, again depending on your hardware, might decrease the overall time ES spends flushing.     

>>>>>> my understanding::
    every refresh makes recent documents visible for searching and after every refresh these document are stored in cache(** may be in-buffer memory).
    there is also translog which log every operation after last commit.
    A commit depends upon translog size, ops, time(30m), in-buffer memory size.
    translog size : 10%
    in-buffer memory : 10% or max 512mb.
