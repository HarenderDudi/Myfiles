conclusion:

1. 50-50 memory for elastic and Lucene [more caching for lucene].
2. dont cross 32 gb heap memory for elastic [compressed ordinary object pointers will be disabled].
3. turn off swapping or lower swappiness, For most Linux systems, this is configured using the sysctl value: vm.swappiness = 1 or you should enable bootstrap.mlockall: true             elasticsearch.yml
4. increase file descriptor: 64k is recommended [for machine or user running elasticsearch]  
    ulimit was set at 65535 file handles, which should be more than enough for a server with a single index.  
    generally limited to 40k on ubuntu
    localhost:9200/_nodes/stats/process?pretty  
    vi /etc/sysctl.conf >>>> fs.file-max = 100000 
    To load new values from the sysctl.conf file >>> sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.conf

5. MMapFS : Ensure that you configure the maximum map count so that there is ample virtual memory available for mmapped files
    sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144        

6. merging[throttle]: for spinning disks you should set index.merge.scheduler.max_thread_count to 1 and indices.store.throttle.max_bytes_per_sec=20mb

7. meting api forced merge API  
   
8. index.translog.flush_threshold_size from the default 512 MB to something larger, such as 1 GB [By letting larger segments build, you flush less often, and the larger segments merge less often. All of this adds up to less disk I/O overhead and better indexing rates].

9. compression

10 index buffer size [10% or 512mb max] 
   
   
    
NOTE :  Find open files limit per process: ulimit -n
        Count all opened files by all process: lsof | wc -l
        Get maximum open files count allowd: cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max       
        
        disable throttling when importing bcz throttling reduces incoming indexing requests to a single thread, which we don't want while importing.
        
        increase refresh interval if only indexing no searching.
