Put a frog into a vessel fill with water and start heating the water.


As the temperature of the water begins to rise, the frog adjust its body temperature accordingly.


The frog keeps adjusting its body temperature with the increasing temperature of the water. Just when the water is about to reach boiling point, the frog cannot adjust anymore. At this point the frog decides to jump out.


The frog tries to jump but it is unable to do so because it has lost all its strength in adjusting with the rising water temperature.
Very soon the frog dies.


What killed the frog?


Think about it!


I know many of us will say the boiling water. But the truth about what killed the frog was its own inability to decide when to jump out.


We all need to adjust with people & situations, but we need to be sure when we need to adjust & when we need to move on. There are times when we need to face the situation and take appropriate actions.


If we allow people to exploit us physically, emotionally, financially, spiritually or mentally they will continue to do so.


Let us decide when to jump!


Let's jump while we still have the strength.
