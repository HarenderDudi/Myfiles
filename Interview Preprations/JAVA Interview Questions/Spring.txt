Instantiation:

When the Spring container starts up, it scans the classpath for components annotated with @Service.
Upon detecting the MyService class annotated with @Service, the Spring container creates an instance of the MyService bean and adds it to the application context.

1.Load Application Context Configuration:
	Spring reads the configuration files or annotations that define the beans and their dependencies.
	Configuration sources include XML-based configuration files, Java-based configuration classes annotated with @Configuration, component scanning annotations such as @ComponentScan, and other metadata sources like @PropertySource for externalized configuration.

2.Instantiate Bean Factory:
	Spring creates an instance of the bean factory, which is responsible for managing and creating beans within the application context.
	The type of bean factory depends on the configuration method used (e.g., XmlBeanFactory, AnnotationConfigApplicationContext, GenericApplicationContext).

3.Resolve Bean Definitions:
	Spring parses the bean definitions from the configuration sources and resolves them into bean metadata.
	Bean metadata includes information such as bean class, dependencies, initialization methods, destruction methods, and scope.

4.Register Bean Definitions:
	Spring registers the resolved bean definitions with the bean factory.
	Each bean definition is associated with a unique identifier (bean name) and stored in the bean factory's internal registry.

5.Apply Bean Factory Post Processors:
	Before any bean is instantiated, Spring applies any registered BeanFactoryPostProcessor implementations to modify the bean definitions.
	BeanFactoryPostProcessors have the opportunity to customize the configuration metadata before beans are created.

6.Instantiate Singletons (Eager Initialization):

	If the beans are configured as singletons and marked for eager initialization, Spring creates instances of singleton beans eagerly during the application context initialization phase.
	Singleton beans are instantiated before any other beans are requested or accessed.

7.Initialize Environment and Property Sources:
	Spring initializes the environment by loading property sources, such as property files, system properties, environment variables, and other externalized configurations.
	Property sources are used to resolve placeholders and inject values into bean properties.

8.Post-Initialization Cleanup:
	Spring performs any necessary cleanup or finalization tasks to prepare the application context for use.
	This may include releasing resources, closing streams, or performing other cleanup operations.



BeanFactoryPostProcessor:

	Execution Time: Executed before bean instantiation.
	Purpose: Allows modification of bean definitions before they are instantiated by the container.
	Example: A common use case is to customize bean definitions based on external configurations or conditions.
	
BeanPostProcessor:
	postProcessBeforeInitialization & postProcessAfterInitialization

	Execution Time: Executed after bean instantiation but before initialization.
	Purpose: Provides hooks for customizing bean instantiation and initialization.
	Example: A common use case is to perform custom initialization logic for all beans, such as logging or security checks.
