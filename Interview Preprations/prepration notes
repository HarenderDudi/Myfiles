Hey! I'm also just getting started with machine learning and am looking for some people to do some kaggle competitions with. I probably have less experience than you with the python libraries but I have taken some online data science courses and have a BASc in mechanical engineering. Let me know if you wanna try working togther :)

 I have learned a few courses related to machine learning, e.g. machine learning by Andrew NG in Coursera. I am really looking forward to form a team and go on competitions to gain some experiences. Plz let me know if I could join your team.

Hi, if you find my son's profile suitable to yours. You can contact me on 9860302353 or  if you want to directly contact Harender then you can reach him on 8796378110 else drop your number I will contact you.
